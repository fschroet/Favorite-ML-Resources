# Favorite somewhat ML related resources

In this file i want to maintain a small list of my favorite resources (Papers, Blogs, Videos...) i found while trying to understand machine learning concepts. My favorite way of studying is gaining not only a theoretical understanding but also a strong intuition of the topics. For me especially the intuitive part promotes fun and motivates me to dive deeper into certain topics.
