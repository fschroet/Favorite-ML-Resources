# Favorite-ML-Resources

In this file i want to maintain a small list of my favorite resources (Papers, Blogs, Videos...) i found while trying to understand machine learning concepts. My favorite way of studying is gaining next to a theoretical understanding a strong intuition of the topics. 


*Articles*: 
- **The illustrated Transformer** \

- **Visual exploration gaussian processes** \
  https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/
- **Prompt Engineering** (Great blog in general) \

*Resources especially useful for maths:* 
- **Mathematics for Machine Learning** \
  I loved reading this book. It was relatively easy to consume while still providing very useful intuitions and perspectives. \
